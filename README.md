The website I am doing about is on â€œ Best Food and Dishes in Singapore". It consists of the home page, catalogue, food news as well as the 
food reviews.

Home page is basically just a home page.
Catalogue is on the most famous food and dishes in Sinagpore, etc. Chicken Rice, Chilli Crab.
Food news is on the recent openings or deals found in Singapore.
Food reviews is on the famous hawker centres, restaurants and cafes in Singapore.

# Design Process

The purpose of designing this website is to allow tourists as well as locals to know the different food and places in Singapore. For tourists, it is a good way to start their journey in Singapore as there are locations and contacts for the different stalls. There is also recommended places for them to go too. As for locals, it allows them to know what deals and new openings are there in Singapore, as they may be bored from the normal food, and may want to look for new stalls to try out. They are links to most stalls which allows them to know the details clearer.

As a foreign, new to Singapore, I would want to know the famous dishes in Singapore so that I am able to enjoy the local delights and know more about the Singaporean style. The catalogue and food review section has the most famous food and stalls recommended respectively. There are contacts and locations (nearest Mrt) avaliable which is user friendly for me. The pictures are also attractive to me and makes me want to travel around Singapore more for all the food.

# Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Alert box:
Go to the "Catalogue" page
Scroll to the bottom 
Press the next button
It should pop out an alert box that says "Do you want to continue?"
After pressing "ok" it should proceed to the next page
